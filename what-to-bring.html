<h3>What you should bring</h3>
<p class="hawaii-gen-info"> Since the temperature in Hawaii is generally relatively high,
    packing for your amazing trip should be easy: just get a couple of T-shorts, a swimming suit,
    a pair of pants, and a towel, and you're good to go! You'll find an abundance of <em>hawaian shirts</em>
    everywhere at your arrival, so no need to waste baggage space with those. </p>
