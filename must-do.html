It's not Venice, but the Arno offers an unique way to discover many of Florence's wonders, and rowing is an excellent way to
compansate for eating pasta twice a day :) <br> <br>

<h4>Watch the sun set over the Arno</h4>
    This one kind of writes itself, but anyway: watching the sun set over the Arno is really amazing, especially if you have someone to share
    it with.

<h4>Go to the stadium and cheer for the Fiorentina</h4>
    Soccers is really, <em> really </em> important in every major italian city, and saying that you root for the wrong team (which in 
    9 cases out of 10 is the Juventus) could seriously get you in a fight. We even write poems and songs about how bad Juventus is, but 
    I can't put them here because they have bad words and I'm trying to get an A ¯\_(ツ)_/¯  <br> <br>

<h4> Walk amongst the workshops</h4>
    Walking amongst the workshops offers tourists an unique occasion to see how manifacturers realize their intricate creations, 
    and could also show them a new part of the city that not many get to experience. <br> <br>
