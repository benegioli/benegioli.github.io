        <br> All of these songs have been written about Florence, some from people who missed it, some from people who had never been there but
        who wanted to discover it's wonders, and some from tourists who fell in love with it after visiting it; even though their perspectives are really different,
        they all agree on one thing: Florence is a truly magical city. <br>

        <strong>Dante Alighieri</strong> <br>
        SO, before copying and pastying a bunch of facts about Dante, lemme tell you that he is a <strong>boi</strong>. He wrote the Divine Comedy, which is
        one of the most important fictional books ever written, according to the great mind of Me. Also he didn't use lazy rhyming schemes in it like other poets
        do, with their pathetic AABB or ABAB..everybody can do that. Literally every rapper that I listen to does that in <em>every</em> song. But Dante's a boi, so he actually writes
        ABABCB, and that takes effort. Shoutout to my italian teacher for scaring me into learning that btw. Now for the Facts: <br>       Dante Alighieri is considered the father of the Italian language, because of his monumental work <em> The Divine Comedy </em>
        , which is universally regarded as the greatest written texts in the italian culture, and one of the best literary masterpieces of the whole world.
        , which is universally regarded as the greatest written texts in the italian culture, and one of the best literary masterpieces of the whole world.
        An important linguist, political theorist and philosopher, Dante spun within the human knowledge, profoundly marking the Italian literature of the following centuries
        as well as Western culture, so much that he was nicknamed the "Great Poet" or simply the "Poet". <br> <br>

        <strong>Giovanni Boccaccio</strong> <br>
        Giovanni Boccaccio was one of the most important figures in the European literary scene of the fourteenth century.
        Some experts define him as the greatest European storyteller of his time, a versatile writer who amalgamated different literary
        tendencies and genres making them converge into original works, thanks to a creative activity carried out under the banner
        of experimentalism. <br> <br>

        <strong>Filippo Brunelleschi</strong> <br>
        Filippo Brunelleschi is considered the first engineer and designer of the modern era; he was one of the first three great
        initiators of the Florentine Renaissance with Donatello and Masaccio. In particular, Brunelleschi was the point of reference
        for the other two and to him we owe the invention of a single point of escape perspective, or "linear centric perspective".
        After an apprenticeship as a goldsmith and a career as a sculptor he devoted himself mainly to architecture, building
        almost exclusively in Florence, both secular and religious buildings that made history. Among these stands out the dome of
        Santa Maria del Fiore, an engineering masterpiece built without the aid of traditional techniques such as the rib.

        <strong>Pietro Cimabue</strong> <br>
        In Cimabue, there is a fundamental step in the transition from hieratic and idealized figures (of Byzantine tradition) to true
        subjects, endowed with humanity and emotions, which will be at the base of Italian and Western painting. He was a painter of
        unscrupulous innovation that even without ever detaching from the proper Byzantine ways, he took them to the extreme consequences,
        one step away from the renewal already pursued in sculpture by Nicola Pisano and then in painting by Giotto

        <strong>Leonardo da Vinci</strong> <br>
        A man of genius and universal talent of the Renaissance, he fully embodied the spirit of his era, bringing it to the greatest forms
        of expression in the most disparate fields of art and knowledge. He dealt with architecture and sculpture, he was draftsman,
        treatise writer, set designer, anatomist, musician, designer and inventor. He is considered one of the greatest geniuses
        of humanity. <br>
        (technically he was born in <em> Vinci </em>, but Vinci i  really really close to Florence, so I will count him)

        <strong>Inferno</strong> <br><iframe width="60%" height="250" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BTZx8k4Mln0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe> <br>
        Famous symbologist Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) follows a trail of clues tied to Dante, the great medieval poet. When Langdon wakes up in an Italian hospital with amnesia, he teams up with Sienna Brooks (Felicity Jones), a doctor he hopes will help him recover his memories. Together, they race across Europe and against the clock to stop a madman (Ben Foster) from unleashing a virus that could wipe out half of the world's population. <br><br>

        <em>Hannibal</em>, the sequel to <em>Silence Of the Lambs,</em> was set in Florence. It's a creepy movie that continues the story
        of Hannibal Lecter, and that offers to the audience some magnific shots of Florence. <br> <br>

        Assassin's creed is cool  is set in XVth century Florence, and while it is not a movie, I think it's relevant so I decided to include it ^-^
        E poi ho scoperto che ci sono varie stagioni di Assassin;s Creed e che solo un e' ambientata a Firenze e che according
        to mio fratello non e' neanche la migliore, ma insomma.
