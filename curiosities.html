    <br> All of these songs have been written about Florence, some from people who missed it, some from people who had never been there but 
    who wanted to discover it's wonders, and some from tourists who fell in love with it after visiting it; even though their perspectives are really different, 
    they all agree on one thing: Florence is a truly magical city. <br>

    <h4 id="people-from-florence">People From Florence</h4>
    <strong>Dante Alighieri</strong> <br>
    Dante Alighieri is considered the father of the Italian language, because of his monumental work <em> The Divine Comedy </em>
    , which is universally regarded as the greatest written texts in the italian culture, and one of the best literary masterpieces of the whole world.
    An important linguist, political theorist and philosopher, Dante spun within the human knowledge, profoundly marking the Italian literature of the following centuries 
    as well as Western culture, so much that he was nicknamed the "Great Poet" or simply the "Poet". <br> <br>

<br> <br>
    <strong>Giovanni Boccaccio</strong> <br>
    Giovanni Boccaccio was one of the most important figures in the European literary scene of the fourteenth century.
    Some experts define him as the greatest European storyteller of his time, a versatile writer who amalgamated different literary
    tendencies and genres making them converge into original works, thanks to a creative activity carried out under the banner
    of experimentalism. <br> <br>

    <br> <br>
    <strong>Filippo Brunelleschi</strong> <br>
    Filippo Brunelleschi is considered the first engineer and designer of the modern era; he was one of the first three great
    initiators of the Florentine Renaissance with Donatello and Masaccio. In particular, Brunelleschi was the point of reference
    for the other two and to him we owe the invention of a single point of escape perspective, or "linear centric perspective".
    After an apprenticeship as a goldsmith and a career as a sculptor he devoted himself mainly to architecture, building
    almost exclusively in Florence, both secular and religious buildings that made history. Among these stands out the dome of
    Santa Maria del Fiore, an engineering masterpiece built without the aid of traditional techniques such as the rib.

    <strong>Pietro Cimabue</strong> <br>
    In Cimabue, there is a fundamental step in the transition from hieratic and idealized figures (of Byzantine tradition) to true
    subjects, endowed with humanity and emotions, which will be at the base of Italian and Western painting. He was a painter of
    unscrupulous innovation that even without ever detaching from the proper Byzantine ways, he took them to the extreme consequences,
    one step away from the renewal already pursued in sculpture by Nicola Pisano and then in painting by Giotto

    <strong>Leonardo da Vinci</strong> <br>
    A man of genius and universal talent of the Renaissance, he fully embodied the spirit of his era, bringing it to the greatest forms
    of expression in the most disparate fields of art and knowledge. He dealt with architecture and sculpture, he was draftsman, 
    treatise writer, set designer, anatomist, musician, designer and inventor. He is considered one of the greatest geniuses
    of humanity. <br>
    (technically he was born in <em> Vinci </em>, but Vinci i  really really close to Florence, so I will count him)

   <!-- Da Vinci also invented a bunch of stuff such as the catapult, the machine gun, a flying machine, the automobile, a rudimentary helicopter... -->

    <em>Hannibal</em>, the sequel to <em>Silence Of the Lambs,</em> was set in Florence. It's a creepy movie that continues the story
    of Hannibal Lecter, and that offers to the audience some magnific shots of Florence. <br> <br>

    Assassin's creed is cool  is set in XVth century Florence, and while it is not a movie, I think it's relevant so I decided to include it ^-^
