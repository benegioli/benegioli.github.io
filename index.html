        <h2 id="introduction">Welcome!</h2>
        <p> Hi, and welcome to my blog! <br>
        <strong> :) </strong> <br>
        Here I will tell you about myself, and about the things that I like...because not enough blogs like that exist on the internet already. 
        
        </p>
        <h2 id="presentation"> About me</h2>
        <p>So, my name is Bene. It's short for Benedetta, which means 'Blessed' in italian...and that takes me to the only interesting thing about me, aka the fact that I'm italian. (And by that I mean a real italian, not a person who's grandfather could have been born in Sicily). Now, I could lie and invent a lot of quirky interesting personality traits for myself, but in reality I'm an average 17 year old. Not <em>"average"</em> in the John-Green-way, where it means "special, but only for the ones that care enough and notice it" though, but "average" meaning that I spend most of my free time looking at memes. <br> 
        When I'm not wasting time laughing at dumb edits, I like to waste time by making myself look cool, so I'm going to do that here too :) I have short blue hair because <del>I need attention more than I need oxygen</del> I like colorful things, and I like to skate or watch horror movies that traumatize me into not sleeping for days.</p>
