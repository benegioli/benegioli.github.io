<h4>History</h4>
Firenze has been a city for many millenia now, but it is still transforming and improving.
It probably became a city around the X century BCE, and it was later occupied by the Etruscans,
that took advantage of the Arno for water and commerce. The Romans took control over it in 59 BCE,
because they needed a new military camp, and named it <em>Florentia</em>. From this moment on, Florence
started growing and gaining importance, to the point that it became the capital of the Kingdom of Italy
in 1865. <br>
During the Middle Ages, it was an extremely important center for commerce and politics, but it know it's
best time during the Renaissance; Capital of art from the fifteenth century, the city guards the treasures
of great masters such as Botticelli, Michelangelo and Brunelleschi. <br> <br>
