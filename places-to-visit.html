<div class="dome">
    <h4 id="dome">Brunelleschi's Dome and Campanile di Giotto</h4>
    This is one of the most beautiful and fascinating buildings of the worlds; skilled architects are still not sure exactly how it 
    was built. It was the largest dome in the world and still remains the largest masonry dome ever built. Thanks to the fundamental 
    importance that it has played for the subsequent development of architecture and modern conception of construction, it is still 
    today the most important architectural work ever built in Europe since Roman times. Its size prevented the traditional 
    constructive method with the help of cèntine, making sure that many hypotheses were formulated on the construction technique used. <br> <br>

<div class="ponte-vecchio">
    <h4 id="ponte-vecchio"> Ponte Vecchio </h4>
    Ponte Vecchio, or "The Old Bridge" in English doesn't look particularly beautiful from outside, but it has an astonishing 
    collection of jewellery stores inside. It also is one of the symbols of the city of Florence and one of the most famous bridges
    in the world. Legend says that during WWII, when the Germans where bombing down the bridges, they decided to leave
    Ponte Vecchio intact, because it was too beautiful to be detroyed. They probably left it unharmed because it was too small
    for tanks to pass through anyway, but it's still an interesting story. <br> <br>
